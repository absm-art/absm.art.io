The process for making them requires Obsidian to install directory files in the root of the website assets, but GitHub and Jekyll also have directory files in there too.</p>

<p>Anyway if this shows up, it will mean that all I have to do is format Obsidian documents I create and they’ll work fine for the site. Since Obsidian is a powerful markdown editor in its own right, that enables me to do more robust creation and editing, as well as doing more general site maintenance. I have a feeling I’m gonna still wind up needing to use a ‘text editor’-&gt;’local testing’-&gt;’push to github’ setup instead of being able to do realtime testing on my ipad, then upload the page. I can currently download all the files, and I have the ability to open and edit them, but on my ipad, doing realtime html testing is not possible without Obsidian or an expensive alternative.</p>

<p>Long term, the fewer steps the better. I have pretty bad ADHD, and I get stuck on small steps all the time. Once I get the posting system streamlined, the next focus is on getting assets for the site updated and pushed to the right places, then tweaking the appearance and the UI until i like it. Since I’m using a very basic site format to start, I’m really not concerned with making a huge amount of fancy changes for aesthetic reasons. In the future, I’ll spend time looking into how cool effects are achieved in Jekyll/GitHub Pages, and see what I can do about implementing the ones that make sense.</p>

<p>I’m planning on making any shop/sales type stuff available through BigCartel, so keep an eye out for that in the future. I think in the more near-term, I would rather have a newsletter/mailing list, maybe something like a monthly sticker club, and build a body of customers and community through connections and networking rather than trying to sell merch right off the bat.</p>

<p>I have been working on a management document for the business side of making art, a sort of organizational flow chart for projects so that I can follow a concrete set of steps. I’m pretty confident in the type of expectations I’m putting on myself as a creator, I think I’m still safely in the ‘more ideas than time’ zone, and that’s where I need to stay until some kind of income can happen. I’m still supporting myself with terrible gig work, and everything I’m working on is a part of the process of getting out.</p>

<p>If you’re reading my posts and following along, thank you! I often feel like I have nothing to contribute, like no one would have a reason to see or think about my experiences or opinions. One of the things I try to keep in my head is the idea that creation isn’t necessarily about an audience– if the things I’m making are important to me, even if it’s just a document of the things I’m working on, then presenting it to the world creates the chance that I could help someone , inspire someone, entertain someone, completely out of nothing.</p>

<p>Anyway, have a nice day! I hope to have art posted on this site sooner rather than later. Once I do, I will begin the process of more formally sharing the site and promoting it. In a lot of ways, these are the first steps towards making a career out of creativity. I’ve been hesitant to move into a more professional space until I can feel confident about my portfolio, my skills, and my experience, and I’m growing more into that space every day now.</p>

<p>I’m excited to share the journey with you!</p>

<p>I suppose, aside from the ‘about me’ page and the inaugural ‘what the hell is a website’ post, this is the first time I’m writing something that will be published under my own name, as a part of my own project, on my own power. I feel very lucky that I’ve had the opportunity through the course of my life to learn a ton across a huge number of subjects, including computer science, writing, SEO, design. I’m excited to use those skills to make something that really represents me.</p>

<p>It’s gonna be slow going at first. This site is going to be a repository for my thoughts and feelings, project notes, portfolio pieces, events and news, and eventually the main base of operations for things like a shop or a support page like patreon. I’m basically only a couple of hours into any one skill I want to develop, so things like the design of this page, the art and assets used, the style and format of posts, and even the medium I use to tell stories will change over time.</p>

<p>Telling stories is something I do like breathing. There have been times in my life when my tendency to narrativize and oversimplify were out of control, caused me and others harm. The journey I’m on demands that I confront things about myself that I don’t like, that have been stigmatized, or that have harmed others. The beauty of growth is in turning weakness into strength– I have grown, and I value the part of me that seeks meaning and beauty in the world and in others. The journey of my life has been the journey of a creator, an artist, a storyteller, a wanderer. I want to bring that light of belonging and the wisdom of my travels to the people I meet.</p>

<p>Making things isn’t always about money, or fame, or even sharing with others. The product of any life is stuff. What stuff we choose to leave behind matters, and I’ve been through enough to finally realize that what I want to leave behind is a signpost for people like me. A marker, a story in stone that says “I was here. I made it. It was hard, but it was worth it. You can make it too.” Even if one person sees it, even if no one sees it, it was there. I was here.</p>

<p>I’ve thought a lot about the times we live in lately. It’s no secret that the country I was born in has changed. They’re opening the camps. They’re starting to talk about taking citizens, they’ve already been taking innocents. There’s some chance, if things change, that people like me won’t make it, or if we do, that we will have to flee, fight, that everything might change in an instant. The world the wealthy have made for us is full of contradictions– here we are, living in the land of the free.</p>

<p>It’s hard to want anything now. It’s hard to do anything now. I’ve been off my primary job for ~6 months now, still employed but barely. Applying seems like a farce, like it would only serve to batter me further. I’ve been 20 different things at 15 different places in my career, and like a lot of things, it feels like I’ve been uniquely chosen to suffer job trauma of one species or another at nearly every stop along the way.</p>

<p>I’m still confident. I’m still excited. I still have lots I want to do, so many ideas I want to actualize. Finding a voice, finding the courage to stand up and say “I am an artist”… that discovery has changed my life. Things I felt shame over, things I hid and pretended I didn’t care about, things I was told would never matter, never be good enough at, never make it if I tried. It’s all come crashing into me. Gus will tell you, I’ve been as volatile emotionally as I can remember ever being- and it’s mostly because I’m so damn energized by ART.</p>

<p>So in the end, I had to start somewhere. I’m good at putting one foot in front of the other, I can keep my feet and keep my head. I finally found a road I enjoy traveling down, all I need is some supplies, some support, and some community. I’m gonna try blasting out some posts off the cuff like this, no edits, raw brain. If you want to let me know you found the site, hit me up on BlueSky! My email is always open for communications as well.</p>

<p>Making things isn’t necessarily about showing them to people, but in my experience, making things always seems to go better when you have good friends to help you along the way, and share in the creation with. I hope you’ll join me on the quest for great stories!</p>

<p>Various formatting tricks will probably break this functionality, but for now we’re ballin</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>This site was made using Ruby and Jekyll, and is deployed using GitHub Pages via a domain name acquired at PorkBun. The site formatting and template are based on the Jekyll template Minimal Mistakes.</p>

<p>The content here is made possible by contributors and viewers like you!</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>Looks like the ‘layout’ setting for posts isn’t pointing to anything yet. I’m working on getting these pages formatted so I can start making regular blog posts!</p>

<p>For now, it’s cool as hell that this website even works at all. And I’m gaining experience working with Ubuntu, Git, GitHub Pages, and now Ruby and Jekyll! Slay</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>It appears the site is online! There is still a ton to do to get things set up, but the thing is operational and working as expected with posts and images. I’ll post an in-depth guide some time walking through the process!!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, have a nice day!</p>]]></content><author><name>A.B.

I’m starting this website in April of 2025. I’m 34 years old.</p>

<p>I’ve spent a long time waiting and holding myself back. If you want to make something happen, you have to start somewhere.</p>

<p>Welcome. I’m hopeful that I can use this space as a portfolio, journal, and blog for my journey as an artist and a human being. I’m leveraging experience and education in a lot of backgrounds, a huge amount of life experience, and my own personal passion and weirdness to make something beautiful- I don’t know what it’s gonna look like yet, but maybe you can help me figure it out.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll come along with me.</p>]]></content><author><name>A.B. Smart</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My name is Andy. I’m starting this website in April of 2025. I’m 34 years old.]]></summary></entry></feed>
